            The Aye-aye is a type of long-fingered lemur native to Madagascar. This strange looking creature has a special thin middle finger and rodent like teeth that constantly grow.
            Its is the worlds largest noctural primate with an unusal method for finding food. 
            The Aye-aye will tap on trees then chew a hole in them and use its long middle finger to scoop out the grubs. 
            All in all this is an amazing a rare creature.
