             <details id="The_Aye_aye">The Aye-aye is a type of long-fingered lemur native to Madagascar. This strange looking creature has a special thin middle finger and rodent like teeth that constantly grow.
                Its is the worlds largest noctural primate with an unusal method for finding food. 
                The Aye-aye will tap on trees then chew a hole in them and use its long middle finger to scoop out the grubs. 
                All in all this is an amazing and rare creature.</details>
